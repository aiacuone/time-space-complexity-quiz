# Time & Space Complexity Game

An interactive game to practice analyzing time and space complexity of different algorithms. Test your understanding of algorithmic complexity by examining code snippets and guessing their Big O notation.

## Features

- Interactive code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Multiple choice questions for both time and space complexity
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Score tracking
- Responsive design

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash

cd time-space-complexity
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## How to Play

1. Read the provided code snippet carefully
2. Select the time complexity from the dropdown menu
3. Select the space complexity from the dropdown menu
4. Click "Check Answer" to see if you're correct
5. Review the explanation to understand the solution
