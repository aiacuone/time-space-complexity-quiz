# Time & Space Complexity Game

An interactive game to practice analyzing time and space complexity of different algorithms. Test your understanding of algorithmic complexity by examining code snippets and guessing their Big O notation.

## Features

- Interactive code snippets with syntax highlighting
- Multiple choice questions for both time and space complexity
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Score tracking
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Modern, clean user interface

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v8 or higher)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
